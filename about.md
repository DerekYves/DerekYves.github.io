Welcome to my blog! The goal of this site, primarily, is to share tips, tricks and instructions
about the R statistical programming language. I hope to also publish excerpts from my
ongoing research from time to time. 

Professionally, I am the Senior Data Scientist at the Church Pension Group in New York City, and have
worked in the general area of social science/statistics for about fifteen years. 
In addition to my passion for statistical computing, I have a diverse background
that has taken me into the fields of hospital chaplaincy, project management and, 
many years ago, auto repair. For fun I enjoy bicycle touring, running, and, of course, learning about in R. 

This fall my coauthored book [Agents of Neoliberal Globalization](https://books.google.com/books/about/Agents_of_Neoliberal_Globalization.html?id=kc5urgEACAAJ) is coming out with [Cambridge University Press](http://www.cambridge.org). 

Many thank's to [Homer White](https://statistics.rainandrhino.org) for his excellent [knitr-hyde](https://github.com/homerhanumat/knitr-hyde) instructions and template, which form the basis of this site.
